# Psychological-counseling-APP-for-colleges
The mental health problems of college students have gradually become the focus of attention. This project is supported by virtual reality, deep learning, OpenCV and other technologies to design and develop a psychological counseling platform for college students. 
On the one hand, the system provides students with scene interaction experience in a virtual environment and improves students' psychological state through positive guidance. 
On the other hand, the system uses deep learning technology to identify students' micro-expressions, providing support for psychological counseling teachers to determine students' mental states.
